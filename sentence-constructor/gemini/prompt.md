| Word        | Japanese     | Romaji         | Type                 |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| bear        | 熊（くま）    | Kuma           | Noun                 |
| door        | ドア        | Doa            | Noun                 |
| garbage     | ゴミ        | Gomi           | Noun                 |
| to be (location) | いる        | Iru            | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
| to leave (out) | 出す（だす）  | Dasu           | Transitive Godan Verb |

Possible sentence structure:
[Location] に [Subject] が [Verb], [Object] を [Verb-past]?

Remember that verbs in Japanese have different forms depending on tense and politeness level.  You'll need to conjugate "dasu" (to leave out) into the past tense.  Also, "iru" (to be) describes the existence of living things.  Since bears are living, that's the appropriate verb.


Student Input: 

Did you see the raven this morning? They were looking at our garden.

Konnichiwa! I'm your Learning Coach, here to help you learn Japanese. I see you want to translate "Did you see the raven this morning? They were looking at our garden." That's a great goal! Let's break it down to make it easier.

Here's a learning plan to tackle this:

1.  **Vocabulary:** We'll identify the key words and their Japanese equivalents.
2.  **Grammar:** We'll look at how to structure the sentence in Japanese, including word order and verb conjugations.
3.  **Putting it together:** We'll combine the vocabulary and grammar to create the complete translation.

Do you want to proceed with this plan, or would you like to revise it?
Yes

Great! Let's start with the vocabulary. Here's a table of the words you'll need, along with their Japanese translations and types:
You got it! Here's the updated vocabulary table with the Romaji added:

| Word          | Japanese      | Romaji        | Type                 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| raven         | カラス         | Karasu        | Noun                 |
| this morning  | 今朝（けさ）    | Kesa          | Noun (Temporal)      |
| to see        | 見る（みる）    | Miru          | Transitive Ichidan Verb |
| garden        | 庭（にわ）      | Niwa          | Noun                 |
| to look (at) | 見る（みる）    | Miru          | Transitive Ichidan Verb |
| our           | 私たちの（わたしたちの） | Watashitachi no | Pronoun (possessive) |

A few things to keep in mind:

*   "To see" and "to look (at)" are the same verb in Japanese. The context will make it clear which one you mean.
*   Japanese sentences often omit the subject if it's obvious from the context. In this case, "they" likely refers to the ravens, so you might not need to explicitly include a pronoun.

Any questions about the vocabulary? Or would you like to try a little activity to help you remember these words?
